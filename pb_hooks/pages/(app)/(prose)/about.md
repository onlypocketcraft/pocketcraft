# About PocketCraft

## Our Journey

PocketCraft was founded in 2024 by [Ben Allfree](https://github.com/benallfree), bringing his extensive experience as the founder of PocketHost and his background in education to create a comprehensive learning platform for the PocketBase ecosystem. With a passion for teaching and a deep understanding of PocketBase's capabilities, Ben established PocketCraft to make learning more accessible and engaging for developers at all skill levels.

## Content Philosophy

We believe in providing multiple learning paths to accommodate different learning styles. While our documentation and written tutorials are freely available, we also offer premium video content through our GitHub Sponsors program. This hybrid model allows us to maintain high-quality educational resources while ensuring sustainable content creation.

## Open Source Foundation

PocketCraft's platform is built on open-source principles, with our site's codebase freely available for inspection and contribution. While the platform itself is open source, our premium content remains exclusive to our supporters, creating a balanced ecosystem that benefits both casual learners and dedicated subscribers.

## Technology and Innovation

We practice what we preach by building PocketCraft with the very technologies we teach:

- **PocketBase**: Our entire backend is powered by PocketBase, showcasing its capabilities in a real-world application
- **HTMX**: We leverage HTMX for dynamic, server-side rendered interactions
- **PocketPages.dev**: Our content management and routing is handled by PocketPages
- **PocketHost**: We trust our sister project, PocketHost, for reliable hosting
